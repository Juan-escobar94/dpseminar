    When a recursive algorithm repeatedly revisits the same subproblem in different branches along its recursion
    tree, we say that the problem has overlapping subproblems.

    In optimization problems on which Dynamic Programming is applied to, the optimal solution to the problem contains 
    within it optimal solution to subproblems.\cite{cormen2009introduction}

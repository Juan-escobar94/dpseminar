\section{elements of dynamic Programming}

Having seen how beneficial Dynamic Programming (from now on \emph{DP} can be, it would be logical to
try to adapt algorithms to use a DP similar approach, but this is not always possible.
A problem must have specific properties in order to be solved in a DP fashion. We have
mentioned this traits: Optimal Substructures and Overlapping Substructures.

\subsection{Optimal Substructures}

as we have seen in the fibonacci example, solutions to problems are 
related to solution to sub problems. The Tree representation for fibonacci makes
this concept very clear.

\subsection{Overlapping Subproblems}

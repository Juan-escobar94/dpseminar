\section{Solving Dynamic Programming Problems}

A general way to solve Dynamic Programming problems, as seen in \cite{cormen2009introduction}:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
  \item Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
  \item Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
  \item Construct an optimal solution from computed information.
\end{enumerate}
